I am Amna Zaidi, I have a background in poduct design and
 I have started my masters in MFA Design & Technology this fall 2024, 
 I loved CCLab classes as we got to learn coding in such a dynamic and on a 
 very interesting platform. This portfolio is a reflaction and an outcome of the time spent honing our skills in the domain,
  I would want to keep exploring and creating.
